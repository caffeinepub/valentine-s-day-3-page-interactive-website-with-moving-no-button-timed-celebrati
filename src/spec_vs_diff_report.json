  "summary": "The diff implements the continuously visible moving “No” button via transform-based animation, replaces the fireworks background with a live canvas burst animation, switches the finale from video to an image using IMG_6912.jpeg with a fallback message, and updates the README to document the image filename and placement path. Some additional Valentine theming/style system changes appear beyond the explicit request.",
