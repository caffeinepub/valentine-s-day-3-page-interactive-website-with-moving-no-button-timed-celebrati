  "summary": "The diff updates QuestionPage.tsx to place the “No” button adjacent to “Yes” in the same flex layout, tracks “No” clicks to progressively shrink via scale transform, and removes the “No” button after 4 presses. The Question page no longer shows any useMovingNoButton-driven translate/orbit behavior. However, the diff also modifies files that were not requested by the BuildRequest (notably useMovingNoButton.ts and metadata/state files).",

    {
      "description": "Modified the useMovingNoButton hook implementation even though the request only required stopping its use on the Question page (not changing the hook itself).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest REQ-3 asks to remove/stop using the hook for the Question page; it does not request changes to the hook file itself.",
